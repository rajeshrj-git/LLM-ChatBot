# Building an Intelligent LLM Chatbot with RAG and Advanced Tooling

Currently developing a robust chatbot using **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, equipped with specialized tools to enhance functionality:

## Features:
- **Web Scraping**: Automates the extraction of job openings and other relevant data from websites.
- **Database Integration**: Connects to a MongoDB database to fetch and manage resume details (e.g., name, email, contact, and PDF).
- **Vector Store Retrieval**: Leverages vector embeddings to provide insights about organizations and their services.

## Overview:
This project bridges **AI** and practical workflows, demonstrating expertise in **LLMs**, **data retrieval**, and **automation**. Excited to create cutting-edge solutions that address real-world challenges!
